# testbench
2 modes:
Interactive, where you are prompted in the command line to give each portion of
your test bench in sequence. The first two screenshots show an example of this
and the resulting testbench: https://imgur.com/a/tydHv9U
Note that here I used the default comprehensive test, described on line 13
	
Default, where you must specify every aspect of your testbench as a command
line argument. The last two screenshots show you an example of this and the
resulting testbench: https://imgur.com/a/tydHv9U
Note that here I manually chose the combination of inputs to use.

Bear in mind that you can manually choose what combination of inputs to have
tested, but, by default, the program will test all possible combinations, so
testbenches can run thousands of lines if the inputs are numerous/large enough

If you want it to do something else, let me know on the github page:

Or you can do it yourself and yeet me a pull request/open an issue on github
and I'll upload it.
Or you can not use it, since it doesn't save much effort compared to just
writing the testbench, but I didn't realize that until I was too far in so I
finished it anyway.
